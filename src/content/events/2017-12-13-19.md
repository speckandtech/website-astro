There are hundreds of thousands of decisions that your team needs to take every single day and without a clear design framework to rely on you'll probably have an inconsistent and hard-to-use outcome ðŸ¤– In the same way, your product will be hard to develop, maintain and it'll cost you a lot of $$$ ðŸ’°<br/>
