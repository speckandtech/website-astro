## Don't you know that you're toxic?

### Federica Pecoraro -- Head of UX @[Fightbean](https://www.fightbean.it/)

Long hours spent in the workplace, a stressful workload, and a lack of free time have become the measure of productivity for professionals. The answer isn’t more hours — it’s less waste, fewer distraction and no toxic behaviours ♻️
Having a calm and productive environment is a choice. We can do our best and deliver an amazing product without making ourselves miserable working like mad to meet some insane expectation 🤬
Federica will show how Fightbean is promoting a respectful and meaningful culture to let people do their work in the best-not crazy way possible 😎

What if you could spend one fifth of your working day on something you are passionate about? 🤔What if you could channel all your creativity and inspiration into something that you truly believe in, something that may - or may not - benefit your employer's business (or your own)? What if I tell you that you could eliminate procrastination from your life, simply by spending 20% of your time doing just what you really want to do? 😍
