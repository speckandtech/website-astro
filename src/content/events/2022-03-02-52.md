Formula SAE is one of the most challenging, fun, and ambitious projects that a student can take part in. It’s a worldwide championship between college Universities where each team has the objective of designing, building, and racing a single-seat racing car. In this talk, we will present our team and we will dive deeper into the technologies that we use to develop every control unit in the vehicle.
