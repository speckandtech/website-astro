## Design sprint - What is it and how it works

### Giulio Michelon - Belka, CEO & Co-founder

The "Design Sprint" is a five-day (!) process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers. This technique has been developed by GV (Google Ventures). I've run my first sprint with a company we are partner with, and it's been amazing! üòç I will tell you the whole story, the downsides and the upsides of using it in your own projects.
