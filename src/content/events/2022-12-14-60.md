Iâ€™ll share some of the things I have learned from past mistakes on how to shape better conversations around design work.

But how can you tell if it's well made - and if it can make a difference when trying to land an interview or a client? I will walk you through the most common design mistakes to avoid via real-life examples so that you can create a website that is delightful and that can take you where you want to go!
