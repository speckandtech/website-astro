## From leaf to orbit

### Daniele Marinelli - Researcher @ [Fondazione Edmund Mach](//cri.fmach.it){:target="\_blank"}

Forests are vital to our planet's health and to many human activities. Given the increasing impact of climate change and human actions, monitoring the condition of our forests has become imperative. At the Forest Ecology Unit of Fondazione Edmund Mach, we employ an array of cutting-edge technologies to examine forest dynamics and enhance management practices. From tree-mounted sensors to orbiting satellites, the talk will provide an overview of the technologies at our disposal and how we are using them.
